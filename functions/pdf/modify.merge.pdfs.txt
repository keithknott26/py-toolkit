### Merging Multiple PDFs using Python

You Need  to open your favourite Editor , create folder name 'PDFmerge'  inside create file 'mergePDF.py' copy and paste code from mergePDF.py file this repo. 

Open Terminal type 

```py
pip install PyPDF2

```

You need to keep PDF files that you want to merge in Pythonâ€™s working directory.Of course, you can change the directory using Python code. For simplicity of code, I am placing the PDF files on the working directory.


```py
python3 mergePDF.py 

```


After Runnig this Code you will get output as the Merged pdf file.
